🤵 Stakeholder is referenced as someone who is planning to list residences in Austin, Texas

✨ I have come up with many useful insights and visualizations based on seven different features and some custom filters for any listing

### Helper Modules 💁‍♂️
I have created two helper modules to reduce redundancy for finding insights
- **groupby_helper:** - contains methods to ease analysis based on groups
- **plot_helper:** - contains methods for ease plotting of bar charts
